# pysparkVideoGameSales

Purpose: Using Apache Spark with Python (pyspark) to solve business problem relating to video game sales.
I previously solved this problem using MapReduce (see my MRJobVideoGameSales repo for more info). 

Dataset retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales.

The version of the dataset included in this repo has the first column and first row removed (Rank and Field Names).

The output ("vidya-spark.txt") ranks video games from the shooter genre by global sales in descending order.
